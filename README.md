# Uberspace Ghost Init Skript

Small script for initializing a ghost installation on Uberspace 7 with default settings. It's using the Ghost-CLI and working fine as far as I know.

Some checks and a cancel on error would be nice, but my bash skriptings skills aren't good enough and I don't plan to setup that many hosts.. Maybe someone can write a pull request? :)

Any comments are welcome.
